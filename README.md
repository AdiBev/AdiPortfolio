# MaterialUi-Portfolio

I remade my old [portfolio](https://adi-portfolio.firebaseapp.com/) using [MaterialUi](https://material-ui.com/) framework. I made this portfolio while I was learning MaterialUi. I learned about CSS in JS, MaterialUi themes system, and it's different components. 

I added a new feature to my portfolio where users can choose different themes of their like. I was able to achieve this using MUiThemeProvider component. I also added some icons from [MaterialUi icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline)

Overall I found MaterialUi framework easy to use and it is highly customizable.
